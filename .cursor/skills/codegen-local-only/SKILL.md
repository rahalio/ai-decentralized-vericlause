# Codegen is local-only

`.codegen` must never be committed or pushed to GitHub.

- Copy the toolchain from `/Users/nrahal/@code/zero-apps/zero-apps-codegen-scaffold/.codegen` into this repo when needed. Do not move or delete anything in the original scaffold.
- After copy, run `pnpm codegen:paths`.
- `.gitignore` already lists `.codegen/`, `codegen/`, and `**/zero_codegen/`.
- If those paths appear in `git status`, unstage them. Never `git add -f` them.
